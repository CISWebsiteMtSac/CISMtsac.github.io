      <h3>Cyber Quests</h3>

      <p class="info">
        <strong>&nbsp;</strong>
        Cyber Quests are a series of online competitions that allows students to show their knowledge
        of information security, in which each quest requires the student to analyze a part of the security
        to see what is wrong by answering questions. The quests can range from identifying what is the most
        vulnerable to which is the most flawed part of the security. Naturally, the quests will be ranged for
        beginners with little to no experience, intermediate, to experienced experts knowledgable of cyber security.
