      <h3>The National Cyber League</h3>
      
      <!-- Like the other paragraphs, this one is in class info, which establishes
      what they should look like -->
      <p class="info">
        <strong>&nbsp;</strong>
        The National Cyber League allows the inclusion of anyone, regardless of experience,
        to join and learn about cybersecurity challenges that they will likely encounter
        in their careers. Challenges such as "...identifying hackers from forensic data, pentesting
        and auditing vulnerable websites, recovering from ransomware attacks, and much more!"
        This could be a valuable learning experience for those pursuing a career in cybersecurity!<br><br>

      <h3>Cyber Quests</h3>

      <p class="info">
        <strong>&nbsp;</strong>
        Cyber Quests are a series of online competitions that give students a chance to show off their knowledge
        in information security. Each quest tasks the student with analyzing a security system
        to locate any vulnerabilities. The quests are accessible since they range in difficulty from the level of a
        beginner to that of an experienced expert.
