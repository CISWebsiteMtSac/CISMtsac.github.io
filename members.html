          <p>Former CIS Club President</p>
          <p>
            <strong>When did you graduate and what degree/certificate did you gain from it?</strong><br>
            I graduated Spring of 2017 with my AS in Network Administration & Security Management.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What's your current profession?</strong><br>
            I worked for the last 3.5 years as an IT Analyst for a Major Credit Bureau. I was working heavily with Cloud
            Technologies like AWS. I was very recently hired on to a public energy utility to work as an IT Associate
            rotating within 3 departments. I an currently working with the Networking and Architecture department. In
            this department I will be tasked with maintaining network data circuits and network appliances such as
            switches, routers, firewalls.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How did the CIS department/program help prepare you for your profession or in general?</strong><br>
            The Mt. SAC CIS department was key to preparing me for the IT jobs out there. Of course it is imperative
            that you learn new skills and technologies on your own by completing certificates or pursuing a higher
            education but the CIS department introduced me to people in IT with varying levels of experience. It was
            meeting those people that helped me get to where I am today.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What advice would you give for current students looking for jobs/internships?</strong><br>
            Study hard and NETWORK! You can be an nerd all you want but in the IT world you need people skills as much
            as you need technical skills; maybe even more so. I used to think that being the most knowledgeable person
            in the room was key to getting the job but I learned after countless interviews that I needed to know how to
            interact with people. Attend social mixers hosted by the college, career fairs, talk to your peers; these
            are all great ways to find your next path in IT.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Anything else you want to say?</strong><br>
            One LifeProTip I would offer you is to take care of your physical and mental health. IT is fun, challenging
            and full of free or subsidized food. Seriously, if you neglect your well-being you will gain TONS of weight
            and lose days of sleep. Have a good exercise routine and sleep schedule.

          </p>
          <p>
            I graduated from Mt. Sac in 2018 with an A.S. in Computer Network Administration and Security Management.
          </p>

            <strong>What's your current profession?</strong>

          <p>
            <strong>How did the CIS department/program helped prepare you for your profession or in general?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The CIS program was effective in preparing me for my current profession. When I first started the CIS
            program, I had no formal IT work experience or education. By the time I finished the program, I felt
            confident in the knowledge and skills that I had gained. The classes incorporated hands-on learning.
            Depending on your background, some of the classes can be quite challenging. The challenges I encountered
            certainly helped me grow quickly and solidified what I learned.

            Despite that IT/cybersecurity is a very broad field, the CIS program is focused enough to give you an
            appropriate baseline of knowledge. As part of my work, I analyze the IT environment of different
            organizations. Each organization has its own unique IT environment, yet I still use what I learned from the
            CIS program often. So, in any case, while there is so much to learn, the CIS program is effective in getting
            you started. Please note, to make the most of the program, it is necessary to participate in club activities
            and any competitions. Not participating in these extracurricular activities can be quite detrimental.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What advice would you give for current students looking for jobs/internships?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Volatile economic conditions, barriers to entry, or an otherwise very competitive job market can make
            finding a job in IT/cybersecurity very difficult and discouraging. The demand for years of work experience
            remains a top barrier to entry. However, please do not be discouraged, as it very much can be done.

            First, when applying, plan on submitting at least 30 applications before expecting to hear from potential
            employers. Please consider the many different types of potential employers. Government agency positions tend
            to be more entry-level friendly, and their interviews also tend to be less difficult. You need to search on
            specific sites like USA Jobs to find these positions. In general, many IT/cybersecurity-related jobs require
            you to meet certain eligibility requirements to obtain a security clearance. Please keep this in mind when
            searching for positions.

            In lieu of work experience, here are some ways to strengthen yourself as a candidate: If possible, get
            involved in relevant research projects/writing research papers, as well as presenting them. Participate in
            relevant clubs and note any leadership or events that you have helped organize for that club. If you have
            strong grades in certain relevant classes, list those grades. Include any special electives that you have
            taken. Feel free to note any freelance work you have done. Make your own website/online portfolio and
            include it in your resume. Joining organizations such as InfraGard, ISACA, etc. are also a plus.

            In addition, it often helps to demonstrate that you show care for others. For example, I volunteered at an
            organization for several years. The fact that I volunteered, and in conjunction with activities I did with
            the CIS club, resulted in it being a determining factor on whether I was awarded a scholarship at Cal Poly
            Pomona. I was awarded that scholarship, which ultimately helped lead to the job I have today.

            I fully recommended applying for internships. I did a summer internship in 2019. While I would have
            preferred to get more relevant experience out of my internship than I received, it was worthwhile overall.
            Internships give great networking opportunities and provide an opportunity to evaluate the organizational
            culture of a company. Often there is great potential to be rehired full-time, as I personally knew several
            interns who were rehired for full-time work. Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, such as the
            MITRE Corporation, or Sandia National Laboratories are great places to intern with.

            Finally, obtaining IT certifications help. There is much discussion on what certifications you should get,
            how many you should get, or how useful they are in the grand scheme of things. I have seen times when having
            a certification was useful and other times less so. Bottom line, I recommend obtaining entry-level
            certifications, such as Security+, Network+, etc. This is a good baseline. From that point, I would
            recommend not pursuing additional certifications unless you have a specific reason to do so, such as if a
            certain certification would help lead to you obtaining a certain job or would otherwise directly benefit
            you.

          <p>
            The CIS program allowed me the hands on approach to networking. It allowed me to see what a network engineer
            does and how important it can be in the real world. Mt Sac was actually a stepping stone that prepared me to
            take on my Bachelorâ€™s degree while obtaining many useful certificates along the way such as CCNA/CCNA

          <p>
            My advice would be to practice and apply what you read and learn in order to have a better understanding of
            what your career entails. Be ready and open to any opportunities while starting out and try not to let the
            pay be an influence in the beginning. Hard work pays off and anything in the IT Field would be a great
            choice for a career just pick one and go for it until you get there.
