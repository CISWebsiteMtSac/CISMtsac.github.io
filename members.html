            participated in the National Cyber League competition and I started off not knowing anything about
            cybersecurity. Now, I canâ€™t wait for the next competition. On my leisure time, I try to read as much as I
            can about network security topics and am also focusing on learning how to code.

            this fall to CSUSB and will be majoring in information technology with a concentration in cyber security. I
            would like to explore the different branches within cybersecurity and follow a career path to become a
            cybersecurity analyst or a penetration tester. Some fields that seem interesting and would like to explore

          <p>Former CIS Club President</p>

            1)
            When did you graduate and what degree/certificate did you gain from it?
            I graduated Spring of 2017 with my AS in Network Administration & Security Management.
          </p>
          <p>
            2)
            What's your current profession?
            I worked for the last 3.5 years as an IT Analyst for a Major Credit Bureau. I was working heavily with Cloud
            Technologies like AWS. I was very recently hired on to a public energy utility to work as an IT Associate
            rotating within 3 departments. I an currently working with the Networking and Architecture department. In
            this department I will be tasked with maintaining network data circuits and network appliances such as
            switches, routers, firewalls.
          </p>
          <p>
            3)
            How did the CIS department/program help prepare you for your profession or in general?
            The Mt. SAC CIS department was key to preparing me for the IT jobs out there. Of course it is imperative
            that you learn new skills and technologies on your own by completing certificates or pursuing a higher
            education but the CIS department introduced me to people in IT with varying levels of experience. It was
            meeting those people that helped me get to where I am today.
          </p>
          <p>
            4)
            What advice would you give for current students looking for jobs/internships?
            Study hard and NETWORK! You can be an nerd all you want but in the IT world you need people skills as much
            as you need technical skills; maybe even more so. I used to think that being the most knowledgeable person
            in the room was key to getting the job but I learned after countless interviews that I needed to know how to
            interact with people. Attend social mixers hosted by the college, career fairs, talk to your peers; these
            are all great ways to find your next path in IT.
          </p>
          <p>
            5)
            Anything else you want to say?
            One LifeProTip I would offer you is to take care of your physical and mental health. IT is fun, challenging
            and full of free or subsidized food. Seriously, if you neglect your well-being you will gain TONS of weight
            and lose days of sleep. Have a good exercise routine and sleep schedule.
